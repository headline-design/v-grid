**Key features for enterprise apps:**
🔹 **Performance:** Virtualized rendering for large datasets.
🔹 **UX:** Keyboard navigation and intuitive selection modes.

### Option 2: Focus on Developer Experience
Why do we keep rebuilding the same table components? 🤔

V-Grid is designed to be the last data grid starter you'll need. It provides a robust foundation that handles the hard stuff—sorting, filtering, pagination, and virtualization—so you can focus on your app's unique logic.

It's not just a component; it's a comprehensive starting point for data-heavy applications.

## 5. Vercel Community Forum Post

**Title:** [Showcase] V-Grid: A high-performance data grid template for Next.js

**Body:**
Hey everyone! 👋

I wanted to share a new template I've been working on called **V-Grid**.

We all know that building complex data tables in React can be a pain. You either get a heavy, bloated library that's hard to style, or you have to build everything from scratch.

V-Grid aims to be the sweet spot. It uses **TanStack Table** for the logic (sorting, filtering, state) and **Tailwind CSS** for the styling, all wrapped up in a performance-optimized **Next.js** starter.

**Highlights:**
*   **Virtualization:** Handles large datasets smoothly.
*   **Keyboard Nav:** Users can navigate with arrow keys (huge for admin apps).
*   **Copy/Paste Friendly:** It's built with the same philosophy as shadcn/ui—it's code you own and can modify.

I'd love for you to check it out and let me know what you think!

**👉 Preview & Deploy on v0:** https://v0.app/templates/v-grid-fRhs5MEIcJT
